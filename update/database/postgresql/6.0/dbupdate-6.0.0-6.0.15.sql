-- The pdf export carries its own footer wording.
--
-- Every page of every export used to read "Exponential PDF export", because
-- those words were written into content/pdf/footer.tpl and there was no way to
-- change them short of overriding the template. The wording now belongs to the
-- export and is set on its own edit page: show_footer says whether the footer
-- carries a line of text at all, footer_text says what it reads. Left empty
-- with the box still ticked, the wording that shipped is used, so an export
-- that predates this change looks exactly as it did.

-- OPML exports.
--
-- An RSS export can now be written as OPML, which is a list of feeds rather
-- than a list of articles. Such an export has no content source and no class
-- mapping; what it has instead is a set of outlines, one per row below, each
-- naming another export on this installation or a content node. The address is
-- worked out when the document is written, so renaming a feed cannot leave a
-- dead entry behind.
--
-- opml_head carries the OPML head fields - owner, docs, expansion and window
-- state - as json. One column rather than a dozen, because they are written
-- once, read once and never searched on, and an installation with no OPML
-- export never fills it in.

--
-- The order statuses of a whole order lifecycle.
--
-- An installation shipped with three statuses, Pending, Processing and
-- Delivered, so a shop that takes payment, ships parcels or handles returns
-- had to create its own before it could say where an order stood. These are
-- the steps most shops need, as internal statuses (below 1000) that cannot be
-- removed by mistake: payment (Awaiting payment, Paid, Payment failed),
-- fulfilment (On hold, Backordered, Packed, Shipped, Ready for pickup), the
-- end of an order (Completed, Cancelled) and what can follow it (Return
-- requested, Returned, Partially refunded, Refunded).
--
-- A status is only added when no row has its status_id yet, and its id is left
-- to the database, so a custom status that already uses one of those ids keeps
-- it.
