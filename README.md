# eZ Publish Project Status

**eZ Publish has made it beyond it's end of life in 2021 and survived. Current releases are primarily aimed at easing the requirements to support current versions of the PHP language like PHP 8.2 and 8.3.**

# What is eZ Publish?

## Recent improvements to eZ Publish
eZ Publish (the application of interest) delivered to users worldwide by a web server (PHP built-in, Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, Among others).

eZ Publish with a full complement of all popular and available php extensions installed like SQLite3 users no longer require a dedicated database server anymore with eZ Publish 6.

With PHP we require composer to install eZ Publish software and no other software required to run
the application. This is an incredible improvement to the kernel (core) of eZ Publish.

## What does eZ Publish provide for end users building websites?

eZ Publish is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS (content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

eZ Publish is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.

# What is eZ Platform?

eZ Publish's technological successor, eZ Platform, is a highly extensible, pure Content Managment Platform built upon the ideals core to Symfony. It provides the same flexible content model at it's core like eZ Publish, and has a growing amount of additional features outside the traditional CMS scope provided by means of "Bundles"
extending it.

It is built on top of the full Symfony Framework, giving developers access to "standard" tools for rapid web & application development.

eZ Platform in some users view suffered a slow road to a stable datatype compatability with existing custom implementations of eZ Publish. Today all of these conserns are now gone with a solid choice left leaving both eZ Publish Platform and eZ Platform as serious contenders to be carefully considered. [Netgen's Media Website Core software](https://github.com/netgen/media-site) represents a much more modern eZ Platform core powered by Ibexa OSS. If your going to choose; Choose wisely.
